	<h3>Glasgow Paediatric Echo Course 28th April-1st May 2015</h3>
	</center>

	<p>The Glasgow Yorkhill Paediatric Echo Course has been run for 25 years.  It now runs for a 

full day from Tuesday to Thursday and a morning session on Friday.</p>

<p>Initially it was a 3 day course and only accepted participants with some experience of 

undertaking an echo study, It covered a range of topics from fetal echo to surgical 

requirements and adult congenital heart disease. Over the years two things became apparent; 

many with limited experience wished to attend, and many had largely an interest in neonatal 

diagnosis. The first day has a lecture session on the theory and practice of undertaking 

echocardiography and two practical sessions on performance of studies with normal subjects 

or those with minor abnormalities. It is not practical to run a course with newborns to study, 

so most of the subjects for the practical groups are older. Thus the course is now suitable for 

paediatricians and cardiac physiologists who want to undertake neonatal echoes as well as 

those learning paediatric echocardiography.</p>

<p>For the above reasons we ask you to indicate your main aim from attending the course and 

your experience of echocardiography. This allows us to modify lectures and arrange for the 

practical groups to be composed of those with similar experience.</p>

<p>The format of the course is for morning and afternoon sessions. The first part of each session 

is for talks/lectures and then practical sessions with small groups and demonstrators to teach 

how to undertake the study and demonstrate the abnormal findings. There is a lecture session 

on morphology and a number of practical sessions when heart specimens will be presented 

and examined. If some participants have a particular interest not shared by all it may be 

possible to provide an extra talk on the Friday afternoon.</p>

<p>The course fee of &pound 600 covers the cost of taxis to bring and return subjects for the practical 

sessions, financial gift to patients, handouts, lunches and refreshments and the course dinner 

on Thursday 30th.</p>
